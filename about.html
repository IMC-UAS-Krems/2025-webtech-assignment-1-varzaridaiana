     <h1 >Interior Design</h1>
     <p style="margin-top: 20px;"> Since I was little i had a deep love for optics and design, I think i got that from my mother because she is an interior designer. When i was in 11th grade in High School i did an interior design course which lasted half an year, and i won best project in my group which gave me the opportunity to do an intership in a design company.</p>
     <p>At the course i learned designing softwears as AutoCad and 3dSMax. Before enrolling into this course I underestimated the work that interior designers have to make in order to have good projects, it took a while to perfect my skills but I was surely very proud after I saw the finished Product.
  Here you can see some pictures from my final project.</p>

<h1>Fashion</h1>
<p>Fashion has always fascinated me — not just as clothing, but as a form of self-expression. It`s a language without words, a way to show who we are, how we feel, and what we believe in. I love how trends evolve, how colors and cuts reflect the spirit of a generation, and how each person interprets style in their own unique way.</p>
<p>But fashion isn`t just about following what`s “in.” It`s about choosing what fits you — your body, your personality, your mood. That`s why I`m drawn to the digital side of fashion. My dream is to design fashion-related websites that celebrate individuality, creativity, and confidence. I want to build spaces where people can explore styles, discover inspiration, and feel empowered to define their own look.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 15px; color: antiquewhite;">Combining my love for fashion with my passion for design feels natural. I see websites as digital runways — places where style meets storytelling. And I can`t wait to bring that vision to life.</p>
